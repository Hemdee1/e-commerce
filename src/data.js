      "The Samsung Galaxy A53 5G hits all the important spec points, with a great design and display. It could be Samsung's most popular device of 2022, That's not because it's the best - that's saved for the Galaxy S22 Ultra - or because it's the most ground breaking - that's the Galaxy Z Fold 3 - but because it will define the Samsung mobile experience for the greatest number of people. While it doesn't offer premium materials you'll find on Samsung's higher-placed devices, there's a great feel to the frosted rear, although it is plastic here as many Samsung phones now are. But we like that moulding around the cameras - something that's also now reflected on the slightly lower-placed Galaxy A33 5G launched alongside.",

      "Bold new beginning, His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breath-taking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. A second chance, Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. A darker, more elemental world, From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. Please note, an internet connection and Playstation Plus may be required to play this game.",
